### Building All the Images

To build all the images specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file, use the following command from the root directory of your project (where your `docker-compose.yml` is located):

```bash
docker-compose build
```
This command will build all the Docker images for the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

### Running the Application

To start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file, use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start all the containers. If you want to run them in detached mode (in the background), you can add the `-d` flag:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers without removing them, you can use:
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing All the Images

To remove all images created by the build process, you first need to stop and remove the containers, networks, volumes, and images associated with your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are the commands to do that:

1. Stop the containers if they are running:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

2. Remove the images:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

Alternatively, if you want to remove all Docker images (including those not associated with this project), you can use:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```

This command will remove all images not associated with a running container, or:
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```

This command forces the removal of all images by getting the IDs of all images and passing them to `docker rmi`.
